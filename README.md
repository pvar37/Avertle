# How to play Avertle

Try to force the computer to complete a word.

* You and the computer take turns adding one letter to a growing word fragment.
* If you complete a valid word (4+ letters), you lose.
* If you play a letter that makes it impossible to complete a word, you lose. (This is disallowed by default.)

You can choose from three difficulty levels:
* **Easy:** Computer plays randomly.
* **Medium:** Computer avoids completing a word.
* **Hard:** Computer plays optimally after the first letter to force you to finish a word.

If a word is completed, you can click on the &raquo; icon to view its definition.

Remember: try NOT to make a word!
